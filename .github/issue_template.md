Below you will find NVDA's Github issue template. You might consider swapping
to the preview tab in order to read through the required sections in the
template. This template uses github markdown, to provide formatting for
headings, lists, quotes etc. If you are not familiar with github markdown,
please read through: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

This block is a HTML comment, it can be left in place and will not appear once
the issue is saved. To verify that the issue will display as you expect, swap to
the preview tab. For an explanation of these headings, and examples of the kind
of information that might be included there, see:
https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/Github-issue-template-explanation-and-examples

In all but exceptional circumstances we require this template should be
completed. Your issue will likely be closed if this template has not been
followed.

In most cases an NVDA log file is incredibly helpful when trying to
understand/fix an issue, please remember to attach one. For assistance with
this see: https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/LogFilesAndCrashDumps

If you have trouble following this template, or with the initial investigation
that is required, please politely ask for assistance from the fantastic
community of people on the NVDA users mailing list at
https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda-community/wiki/Connect#international-users-mailing-list-english

**Please note:**
